# Netflix Movies Analysis

This project analyzes movie data from Netflix to understand the trends in movie durations. The project uses Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries to create a DataFrame from a CSV file, filter for movie data, and create a scatter plot of movie release year against duration. The project explores the trend in movie durations over the past two decades and discovers some shorter movies.
